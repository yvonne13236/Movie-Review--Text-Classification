It's a Jupyter Notebook script on text analysis for practice and learning purposes.

There are three movie review sources: Amazon, IMDB and Yelp

For text preprocessing, Keras's Tokenizer is used to vectorize a text corpus into a list of integers.
The final model is trained with a convolutional neural network. Hyperparamter tuning is done using randomized grid search (RandomizedSearchCV).
